Using Bootstrap I have been able to add dropdown menu for the gui assignments. I used the built-in panel class to create background. Then, I used navigation and dropdown classes to make the dropdown links work. Moreover, I have removed box sizes from my css file. The boxes on my page will acquire their size from bootstrap with the use of columns. Finially, I have added "mailto" feature on the email address below contact section. When user clicks on my email, their default email application will open with receipent section filled out.
